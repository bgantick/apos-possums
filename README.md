# Apostrophe Headless Demo

Simple example of `apostrophe-headless` with a single piece type.

Once you have a local copy of this project to work from, make sure to install its dependencies with `npm install`. With Apostrophe installed, the first thing to do create an admin user account so you're able to log into the CMS. Run the following command (this will prompt you for a password).

```bash
node app.js apostrophe-users:add admin admin
```

Now you're all set! Just run `npm start` to start up the local server, head to `localhost:3000/login` in your web browser, log in with your newly created user, and add some possums.
